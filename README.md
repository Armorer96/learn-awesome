# learn-awesome

---

This repo has curated lists of awesome learning resources on various topics.

With the explosion of information available on the Internet, it has become difficult to find the best learning resources on any topic. Some really amazing things are available on the Web, but learning platforms are typically tied to a single format and want to keep you within their site/app. In other words, learning apps are not actually learner-centric. For any given topic (say, machine learning), it should be easy to find best courses, best podcasts, best books, best articles, best Q&A sites, best chat groups, best people to follow, the best research papers, best interactive exercises/playgrounds and so on.

The problem goes beyond simply collecting links. An effective learning system needs to support personalization on at least a few dimensions:

- What formats does the student prefer? The same set of ideas can be consumed in a course, in a shorter TED talk, in a book, in a podcast, in an article etc. The student should be able to filter the set of links on this dimension.
- What's the context of the learning goal? Imagine student A who wants to learn linear algebra for its own sake vs student B who wants to learn it in the context of machine learning. Both will benefit from different learning resources.
- How much time does the student have for learning any topic? When you're short on time, you might prefer a book summary, rather than the original book itself.
- What does the student already know?
- What learning method has the student found most effective?

Eventually, we plan to build a learning app that, instead of locking you in, leverages the awesomeness of the entire Web. Think web directories before Google but one that adapts to you learning goals. However, the first step is to collect the links to the best resources and more importantly, the metadata about them (such as, estimated time reading). In this repo, we create a markdown file for each topic with a specific structure. See this [template](template.md) and the page about [Learning](learning.md) as example.
